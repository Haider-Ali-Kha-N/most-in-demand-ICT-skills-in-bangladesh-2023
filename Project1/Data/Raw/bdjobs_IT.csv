Abroad Inquiry
Address : Block: C, House No: 47, Road No: 6, 5th floor, Niketon, Gulshan 1. Dhaka -1212,
Web : http://abroadinquiry.com
Business : Abroad Inquiry was born in 2017 from an altruist Facebook group that has helped hundreds of international students pursue higher study abroad worldwide. Abroad Inquiry`s a community-based platform run by a group of international students from different countries. Why was the Abroad Inquiry born? The common thing that we noticed is that students are being provided with false information and misleading career guidelines from unauthentic sources, resulting in the refusal of their visa application and career breakthrough. This is not a refusal; we think it’s the death of a dream. At our Abroad Inquiry, we provide all accurate factual information related to higher study abroad that we have acquired from our real-life experience and thorough research. We believe that a current student who has already gone through the hectic study abroad journey can be the best source of information and understand the situation better than others. The information obtained is more authentic than online sources or any other student consultancy firms. Thus, we have built this platform to help upcoming students.

Our mentors have already graduated from top-notch universities in different countries. Moreover, some of them are working at reputed companies working relentlessly to ease the journey of potential future students. However, we decided to serve upcoming students because, as international students, we experienced the same thing before going to a new place. For instance, sufficient information, the difficulty of getting admission, preparation of necessary documents as per the requirement of the respective university, and visa consular office are essential to know from authentic sources. We have an expert team of passionate individuals who are professional to make your dream of studying abroad into a reality. Furthermore, we also provide comprehensive guidelines to manage housing, part-time jobs, study advice, Permanent Residency, etc.

In a nutshell, our company provides complete support from admission to settlement in a foreign country. In addition, students will get all the support and motivation from our mentors who run this company. Therefore, let’s get in touch with us from the very first day of your planning stage.",https://jobs.bdjobs.com/jobdetails.asp?id=1115318&fcatId=8&ln=1
