Equal Opportunities

VSO promotes equal opportunities and values a diverse workforce.

Allowance

As a VSO volunteer, you will be sharing your skills with local communities on a full time basis. VSO will cover your travel, vaccinations, accommodation, and medical insurance costs, along with a local living allowance which will be paid in local currency. This allowance meets reasonable living expenses in country, but will not be enough to send money home. You will also receive some financial support to contribute to your on-going expenses at home.

Accommodation

VSO works with some of the poorest communities in the world which means accommodation varies and will be basic.

Some background about VSO

Much has changed since VSO started 60 years ago. We’ve gone from being a UK charity to a truly global development organisation. In 2016/2017 alone, we worked with over 7,000 volunteers from all over the world and from all backgrounds to deliver services that had an impact on the lives of almost 2.6 million people in the 24 countries where we work. Our programmes focus on the areas of health, education and livelihoods, with an increasing emphasis on resilience building, social accountability, gender and social inclusion. We believe progress is only possible when we work together and that strong partnerships are crucial to delivering positive change. That’s why we work with over 500 partner organisations, from local and national governments, to businesses, NGOs, funders, charities and community groups. Currently, over 30% of our people are recruited from within the country in which they work, and we continue to grow the share of community and national volunteers involved in our programmes. We also send increasing numbers of volunteers from one developing country to another. However, our vision has remained the same; to build a world without poverty.

General Background :

Bhasan Char was established by the Government of Bangladesh to host up to 100,000 Rohingya refugees. Aimed at addressing the overcrowding in Cox Bazar and improving living conditions, the project is led by the Government with relevant ministries and agencies actively involved, as well as national NGOs. UN involvement in Bhasan Char is aimed at supplementing and complementing the humanitarian activities of the national NGOs in support of this national led effort.

On 9 October 2021, the Government of Bangladesh and UNHCR (on behalf of the UN agencies working in Cox’s Bazar) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that established a common protection and policy framework for ongoing and future refugee relief efforts on Bhasan Char. The MoU affirmed a joint commitment to ensure that refugees would move to the island voluntarily, based on a free and informed choice, and that they would have opportunities to move between the island and the mainland. The MoU also confirmed that the current and future refugee population on Bhasan Char has access to services including protection, shelter, food and nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene, health, education, and the ability to engage in livelihoods and capacity building activities.

As of 30 November 2022, 28,760 Rohingya refugees reside on Bhasan Char. The majority 55% are children under the age of 18 years, while 2% are elderly (aged 60 years and above). Women and girls represent 51% of the overall refugee population. A total of 2,171 refugees from 2,036 families, representing 7.9% of the total refugee population on Bhasan Char, were identified as persons with specific needs (PSNs), including 260 individuals with disabilities and 107 individuals suffering from serious medical conditions.

UNHCR in close collaboration with the office of the Refugee Repatriation and Relief Commissioner (RRRC) leads overall response and coordination on the island, which is carried out through eight sectors. The Inter-Agency efforts in 2021-2022 have contributed to an increase in protection space and a coordinated assistance programme mainly focused on providing lifesaving humanitarian assistance, including health, education, setting up community-based protection mechanisms, capacity building, etc.

Sector: Program Administration

Employment Category: Proposal

Employment Type: Full-Time

Open to Expatriates: Yes

Location: Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh

Job Description

Founded in 1933, International Rescue Committee (IRC) is one of the world’s leading agencies working in post-conflict and development contexts, supporting communities in over 40 fragile, failed and developing states. In this capacity, we work to restore safety, dignity and hope to millions who are uprooted, struggling to endure and wishing to advance on a path of development.

IRC has been present in Bangladesh since 2017 and obtained registration with the NGOAB in March 2018. Since IRC obtained registration in March 2018, it has moved quickly to expand its integrated emergency health and protection response through both direct and partner-based programming focused on primary healthcare, women’s protection and empowerment, sexual and reproductive health, gender-based violence and child protection. Through 2018, the IRC’s response strategy will primarily target Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazar, while meeting the significant needs in both refugee and host populations, as already existing vulnerabilities are compounded with cyclical monsoon and cyclone seasons that impose additional threats to the lives and protection of those refugees as well as vulnerable host populations. IRC is growing its programming to cover education and livelihoods/DRR, as well as its geographic footprint in the host community and to other parts of the country.

Purpose of the Role

The IRC is seeking a Chief of Party (COP) for the five-year, $50 million USAID-funded HICRA. This project will encompass a set of innovative interventions, with an overall goal of addressing the social and economic and environmental challenges in the southeastern districts of Cox’s Bazar and Bandarban. The challenges are most acute in the communities directly responsible for hosting the refugee camps. The overall development assistance is expected to be delivered in the following sectors: WASH, nutrition, economic growth (inclusive finance, private sector engagement, microfinance etc.), natural resource management, and agriculture.

The COP will lead a consortium of NGOs and other partners in managing and implementing all aspects of the project, providing overall technical, administrative, operational, and logistical management, with a focus on achieving the project’s objectives/results. This role will be the primary liaison for the project with USAID, relevant Government of Bangladesh Ministries, other donors and institutions, implementing partners, technical agencies and other stakeholders.

This position will report to the IRC Country Director and is contingent on the IRC being awarded funding. It is anticipated to begin in May 2023.

Highlights Of Key Responsibilities

Responsible for ensuring quality and timeliness of all deliverables.
Provide overall leadership, strategic oversight and guidance to the consortium members in order to achieve overall objectives of the project

Job Title: Deputy Chief of Party

Sector: Program Administration

Employment Category: Proposal

Employment Type: Full-Time

Open to Expatriates: Yes

Location: Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh

Job Description

Program Brief

Founded in 1933, International Rescue Committee (IRC) is one of the world’s leading agencies working in post-conflict and development contexts, supporting communities in over 40 fragile, failed and developing states. In this capacity, we work to restore safety, dignity and hope to millions who are uprooted, struggling to endure and wishing to advance on a path of development.

IRC has been present in Bangladesh since 2017 and obtained registration with the NGOAB in March 2018. Since IRC obtained registration in March 2018, it has moved quickly to expand its integrated emergency health and protection response through both direct and partner-based programming focused on primary healthcare, women’s protection and empowerment, sexual and reproductive health, gender-based violence and child protection. Through 2018, the IRC’s response strategy will primarily target Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazar, while meeting the significant needs in both refugee and host populations, as already existing vulnerabilities are compounded with cyclical monsoon and cyclone seasons that impose additional threats to the lives and protection of those refugees as well as vulnerable host populations. IRC is growing its programming to cover education and livelihoods/DRR, as well as its geographic footprint in the host community and to other parts of the country.

Purpose of the Role

The IRC is seeking a Deputy Chief of Party (DCOP) for the five-year, $50 million USAID-funded HICRA. This project will encompass a set of innovative interventions, with an overall goal of addressing the social and economic and environmental challenges in the southeastern districts of Cox’s Bazar and Bandarban. The challenges are most acute in the communities directly responsible for hosting the refugee camps. The overall development assistance is expected to be delivered in the following sectors: WASH, nutrition, economic growth (inclusive finance, private sector engagement, microfinance etc.), natural resource management, and agriculture.

The DCOP with guidance from the COP will lead implementation of all aspects of the project, providing overall administrative, operational, and logistical management, with a focus on achieving the project’s objectives/results. The position will be responsible for acquisition and supervision of the activity’s financial and human resources. The DCOP will be responsible for ensuring the quality and timeliness of all deliverables. The DCOP will oversee effective coordination of activities with those of relevant Government of Bangladesh ministries, international organizations, and other USAID-funded activities in the region. This role will ensure implementation is in accordance with IRC and USAID regulations, liaising regularly with USAID agreement officers, technical support staff, sub-grantees, and implementers of other USAID-funded initiatives as required.

This position will report to the COP and is contingent on the IRC being awarded funding. It is anticipated to begin in May 2023.

Highlights Of Key Responsibilities
Support the COP in providing strategic and technical leadership and direction, defining and implementing activities to achieve the greatest impact toward project goals and objectives; serve as Acting COP in COP’s absence;
Provide financial, operational, procurement and MEL management that optimizes resources through sound budgets, consistent financial tracking, and timely submission of reports to the donor.

Title/ Area: Recruitment of two consultants for costing of the health protection scheme (SSK) interventions with the OneHealth tool in Bangladesh

Activity Lead: Andre Zida

Technical Manager: Abu Zahid, Principal Technical Advisor, MTaPS Bangladesh

Background and description of services to be provided

Background
USAID’s Medicines, Technologies, and Pharmaceutical Services (MTaPS) Program helps low- and middle-income countries strengthen their pharmaceutical systems to ensure people have sustainable access to safe, effective, quality-assured, and affordable essential medicines, and to pharmaceutical services that ensure their appropriate use.
In 2020, MTaPS conducted a review of available costing tools for forecasting spending on pharmaceutical benefits coverage. The goal was to select the best approach to costing pharmaceutical benefits packages and detail how such estimations could be used to support UHC policy discussions. After appraising the costing tools and studies, MTaPS recommended applying the OneHealth Tool (OHT) to support benefit package costing, pharmaceutical package costing, and forecasting.
The OHT is a software tool designed to strengthen health system analysis, planning, costing, and financing scenarios at the national level. The broad purpose of the tool is to assess public health investment needs in low- d middle-income countries (LMICs) and inform the development of medium-term strategic plans for health sector planning. It incorporates epidemiological impact models to determine achievable health gains; combines both disease program-specific and health system-wide planning; and supports planning, costing, budgeting, impact analysis, and financial space analysis all in one tool. It has incorporated several robust planning and costing tools widely in use by countries, including Marginal Budgeting for Bottlenecks (MBB), the Child Health Cost Estimation tool, and the FamPlan and the UNFPA Reproductive Health costing tool. The OHT is publicly available through the IHP+ website (http://www.internationalhealthpartnership.net/en/tools/one-health-tool/ ).
The OHT can also be used to estimate the costs of a pharmaceutical benefits package. To support the application of this tool, MTaPS conducted training for four countries (Bangladesh, Nepal, the Philippines, and Kyrgyzstan) to use the OHT to plan and cost their pharmaceutical benefits package as part of overall national health sector strategic planning. After the training, MTaPS decided to implement the tool in Bangladesh for the country's health protection scheme (SSK) interventions costing. MTaPS is seeking two senior consultants to implement the SSK interventions costing in Bangladesh

Second, the consultants will conduct consultations with national agencies, other relevant stakeholders, and partners to specify the target population for each intervention, the population in need, the baseline coverages, and the drug unit prices.

436,436,Request for Consultant: Maternal and Child Wasting Project (MCW) in Bangladesh,"Results for Development Dhaka, Dhaka, Bangladesh Hybrid",Full-time,"Results for Development (R4D) is a leading non-profit global development partner. We collaborate with change agents around the world — government officials, civil society leaders and social innovators — to create strong systems that support healthy, educated people. We help our partners move from knowing their goal to knowing how to reach it. We combine global expertise in health, education and nutrition with analytic rigor, practical support for decision-making and implementation and access to peer problem-solving networks. Together with our partners, we build self-sustaining systems that serve everyone and deliver lasting results. Then we share what we learn so others can achieve results for development, too.

We have a unique and vibrant culture at R4D. Diversity, equity and inclusion are at the heart of our work environment and help advance our mission. Diversity—of ideas, identities, perspectives and backgrounds—is vital to who we are and what we do. We seek people who embrace these values and will help reinforce them. Our work culture is collaborative, creative and entrepreneurial. We operate based on trust and respect. Teams across the organization frequently collaborate on programmatic work and support each other in continuously building a better R4D.

R4D’s Market Shaping practice area works with change agents to ensure that markets are transformed sustainably to drive increased access to (and improve appropriate use of) essential commodities, such as childhood pneumonia diagnosis and treatments, maternal health supplies, and nutrition supplements. R4D achieves this by aligning priorities and incentives of key market actors including policymakers, procurers, manufacturers, and financiers at the global and country levels to develop and execute solutions for underserved markets at scale.

1.2. Maternal & Child Wasting (MCW) Project Overview:

The “Increasing Access to Maternal and Child Wasting (MCW) Products: Market Analysis and Strategic Options” project funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation aims to address malnutrition in women and children under-five in South Asia (SA) and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where access to life-saving nutritional products remains suboptimal. Undernutrition for women and children is a major driver of infant and child morbidity and mortality. Supplementary and therapeutic products have the proven potential to save many lives and reduce the burden of acute malnutrition – but market access remains low even for the most mature of these products, and innovative products have an uncertain path to reaching scale.

Our project is focused on exploring the potential for the introduction and scale-up of four nutrition products: ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTFs), small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS), balanced energy protein supplements (BEP), and promising alternative formulations of RUTFs including microbiome-directed RUTF (MD-RUTF). This range of promising products is either in-market or progressing through the development pipeline and has the potential to save and improve lives by preventing and treating maternal and child undernutrition. But maximizing the impact of these products will require a better understanding of market barriers and enablers of scale and will require key actors to actively shape the markets for these products both within countries and internationally.

Phase 1 (June 2022 – September 2023): market analysis

Phase 1 started in June 2022 and has been ongoing up until now. We are looking for a consultant to continue this work starting February 1st 2023 onwards. Phase 1 is focused on identifying the market challenges and enablers to increase access to the priority nutrition products. Through data collection and collaborations with stakeholders, donors, implementing partners, and the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh entities including the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, The Central Procurement Technical Unit (CPTU) at the Ministry of Planning, and The Directorate General of Drug Administration (DGDA) under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, the team is analyzing four market-enabling aspects – regulatory environment, financial availability and avenues, demand for products from the government and public sector procurement channels, and supply/production stability – to identify barriers and key areas of opportunity to drive market access. The analysis will focus on the public sector market at the national level in Bangladesh. Phase 1 is expected to end with a milestone meeting with BMGF on or around September 1st , 2023.

R4D’s market scope is focused on the upstream market factors that influence introduction of a new or scale-up of existing nutrition products through government policies and programs. This includes holistically analyzing government’s policies, programs, quantifications (demand), and procurement of nutrition commodities to understand the “health” of the market to bring a product into the country and identifying strategies to improve the market. Upstream market factors include the demand from the government or donors to procure nutrition commodities for the public sector, financing from the government or donors to procure nutrition commodities through public programs, regulation of the public sector and policies that outline nutrition commodities to be included into programs, and suppliers who are or could be supplying to the public sector.

For this project, R4D will not be procuring nutrition commodities, analyzing downstream demand from consumers, assessing the supply chain challenges within the country, or assessing service delivery aspects that can influence availability.

Phase 2 (October 2023 – June 2024): strategic options

In Phase 2, R4D will build on the market diagnostic findings from Phase 1 to develop practical market shaping options to address the identified market challenges, leveraging the data and relationships developed during the first phase and adapting as new data becomes available. Recommendations will focus on cross-cutting options that can impact the whole product class or multiple products within the class but will also look at individual products where unique challenges are identified.

Consultant Role and Scope of Services

R4D is looking for an individual consultant, based in Dhaka, Bangladesh, to support and contribute to the MCW project. The consultant will work closely with a variety of country-level stakeholders and members of the R4D Market Shaping team in Washington, DC to carry out the following list of indicative activities over the time frame from February 1st, 2023 – September 30th, 2023, with a possibility of extension for Phase 2, pending fit and performance, to be determined approximately one-two months prior to the end of Phase 1. Over the course of the consultancy, R4D estimates an average of about 6-8 days of work per month. However, this estimate is only meant to provide an illustrative estimate of expectations. Given the nature of this work, the actual days of work per month may fluctuate and will be determined by the specific activities agreed upon between the Consultant and R4D. The individual will support our market analysis and development of strategic options to increase access to the focus nutrition commodities in Bangladesh.

2.1. Activities:

Phase 1:

Lead stakeholder management with key stakeholders in the nutrition sector in Bangladesh, including leveraging the consultant’s existing relationships, building, and fostering relationships with new key stakeholders for success on this project: government agencies including Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, The Directorate General of Drug Administration (DGDA) under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, The Central Procurement Technical Unit (CPTU) at the Ministry of Planning, donors, implementing partners, civil society organizations, and development partners
Pursue, prepare for, and expertly conduct interviews with key stakeholders in Bangladesh to understand the barriers and enablers for these nutrition products, and use findings to develop insights and hypotheses about the product markets (working closely with the MCW team based in Washington DC through remote working methods)
Support the development of analytic and written deliverables that synthesize information effectively and communicate key findings and policy recommendations from research and analyses to internal and external audiences
Assist in the development of knowledge management and communication strategies to promote the sensitization, dissemination, and uptake of our work
Conduct qualitative and quantitative research and analysis to identify market barriers to product introduction or scale up, including data on the regulatory environment, financial availability and avenues, demand for products and procurement channels, and supply/production stability
The Consultant will support additional activities that are deemed critical to ensure the success of the portfolio of work, e.g., attending internal team meetings and following up on tasks in a timely manner, reviewing nutrition related policy documents and resources, contribution to strategic decisions around changes in activities and/or the timelines associated with each, as well as support planning efforts for any trips made by R4D team members to the country/city

Phase 2 additional activities to the above:

Contribute to and guide the development of potential market shaping solutions via a hypothesis-driven approach to develop recommendations for country level stakeholders, leveraging existing analyses and empirical evidence, in phase 2, contingent on extension.

2.2. Illustrative Deliverables and Project Timeline:

As we take an iterative process to analyze the market barriers and develop strategic options, the consultant will provide input and feedback on various pieces of the project work; an illustrative list of deliverables is as follows:
Nutrition stakeholder mapping and engagement
Interview guides, notes, and key takeaways summarized from various stakeholder interviews, with translation of notes and data are provided in Bengali.
Data collection:
Collection of relevant data e.g. financing, quantification, procurement, pricing, and supplier data in pre-developed templates
Data analysis:
Insights summarized from data collected. Most analysis will be conducted via Excel and summarized in slides, Word, or Excel
Slides or slide decks developed for internal and external meetings, donor milestones, or internal knowledge management purposes. This may include summaries of background research and knowledge, reviewed policy documents, and learnings from stakeholder conversations.

GiveDirectly (GD) aims to reshape international giving – and millions of lives – by providing cash grants directly to the poorest people in the world. The Brookings Institution estimates that $100B of cash transfers would be required to eliminate the poverty gap; the aid sector currently spends $135B each year, much of it on evidence-free interventions. GiveDirectly wants to change that, establishing cash transfers as a benchmark for foreign aid – as the index fund is a benchmark for the financial industry – and in the process accelerating the end of extreme poverty.

GD has raised over $800M since launching in 2011, delivered cash to more than 1 million people, and launched offices in 11 countries across North America, Africa, and the Middle East. We’ve also supported 19 large-scale, experimental research projects that indicate strong recipient impact of our programs – including the largest universal basic income experiment in history. We use concrete evidence to inform the design of our programs: from research results published in leading journals, to in-depth qualitative work. As a result, GD has been celebrated as one of the most innovative non-profit companies by Fast Company, while the growing cash transfer movement (and GD’s leading role within it) have been featured in the New York Times Magazine, This American Life, Foreign Affairs, and The Economist.

We’re looking for exceptional talent to grow our collaborative, diverse team. Joining GiveDirectly provides the opportunity to work alongside individuals who come from 21 different countries and speak 69 different languages. We’re actively working toward an equitable and inclusive environment for all team members, and seek candidates who will bring diverse perspectives and experiences to our organization. We recruit from organizations across all industries: our team has hailed from sectors including start-ups, government, consultancies, investment banks, and nonprofits.

Across our global offices, our culture is candid, analytical, non-hierarchical, and fast-paced. We value ability, adaptability, and willingness to learn. We offer competitive salary and benefits, as well as performance-based bonuses.

Location: This role is based in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

About GiveDirectly

GiveDirectly (GD) aims to reshape international giving – and millions of lives – by providing cash grants directly to the world’s poorest. The Brookings Institution estimates that $70B of cash transfers would be required to eliminate the poverty gap; the aid sector currently spends $135B each year, much of it on evidence-free interventions. GiveDirectly wants to change that, establishing cash transfers as a benchmark for foreign aid – as the index fund is a benchmark for the financial industry – and in the process accelerating the end of extreme poverty.

GD has raised over $700M since launching in 2011, delivered cash to more than 1 million people, and launched offices in 10 countries. We’ve also supported large-scale, experimental research that indicates strong recipient impact of our programs. As a result, GD has been celebrated as one of the most innovative non-profit companies by Fast Company, while the growing cash transfer movement (and GD’s leading role within it) have been featured in the New York Times Magazine, This American Life, Foreign Affairs, and The Economist.

About This Role

GiveDirectly's field organization is growing fast: we recently doubled our country office footprint and are experimenting with a range of research and design questions from ""How do you deliver cash in a country that has 1 bank for a district of 400,000 people?"" to ""What's the impact of providing a universal basic income to 10,000+ individuals?""

We’ve defined a core “big bet” around expansion into the humanitarian response domain, both domestic and international. Our value proposition will focus on speed, flexibility, innovation and rigor. We’re looking for candidates who are able to deploy on short notice to an emergency. The ideal candidate will complete a minimum two year tour of duty, with potential to grow into a Director role and/or to work across a series of geographies and projects.

As part of GD’s launch team, you will hone your operational expertise with responsibilities that include: building new capabilities for targeting beneficiaries, deploying payments, and rapidly setting up in emergency settings; hiring and managing teams of field officers; and hitting quality and efficiency targets in a novel operational context.

687,687,APAC Community Manager (Remote),Filecoin Foundation South Asia Remote,Full-time,"About Filecoin Foundation

Filecoin Foundation (FF) is an independent organization that facilitates governance of the Filecoin network, funds critical development projects, supports the growth of the Filecoin ecosystem, and advocates for Filecoin and the decentralized web. In 2017, the creators of Filecoin envisioned that an independent Filecoin Foundation would serve as the long-term governance body for the Filecoin Ecosystem. They gave the Foundation the mandate to “grow an open ecosystem for decentralized storage” and to “give developers an open and sustainable platform to build, enhance and monetize those services.” They wanted the Foundation to be modeled on Foundations for other open source projects like the Apache Software Foundation, the Mozilla Foundation and the Linux Foundation. Filecoin Foundation operates independently of Protocol Labs, the organization that designed and built the Filecoin network. As a member of our early-stage team, you will have the opportunity to help define our growth as the organization scales. This is a full-time, remote position.

Job Description

Filecoin Foundation is looking for a talented Community Program Manager who can engage with the Filecoin community in Asia Pacific (APAC). Working across multiple channels, this position is designed to synthesize information from various sources to surface and to unstick problems, and operate on cross-functional teams to liaise between the APAC community and the Foundation. The ideal candidate has a savvy approach to community engagement and can make members feel welcome. This person will act as a critical bridge between the wider Filecoin community within the APAC region and the Foundation as well as a way-finder for community members to find the resources and support they need.

APAC is our fastest growing region and a typical day in this role doesn’t exist. Working with online communities means being able to constantly reprioritize, identify opportunities for kick-starting conversations, and read between the lines to proactively identify tools, solutions, and other opportunities for improving the experience of community members. One day, you may be hopping around our (many) Slack channels, providing updates and bringing folks together; the next, you’re working with our ecosystem team to redesign the ‘Filecoin Community’ landing page; the next day, you find a complex system problem that the community needs help deliberating. Regardless, you're proactive, confident and capable, and value your role as a source-of-truth for problem solving. You also have great judgment, knowing when to drop a meme and when to provide clear instructions.

This position is designed to own program execution across Singapore, Japan, China, India, Korea, and other smaller emerging markets within the region. The person who will thrive in this role should be naturally proactive and have the ability to easily transition between strategic thinking and tactical/detailed execution and project management. The kind of person who isn’t afraid to insert themselves and loves chatting, networking, and building connections while also focusing on ways to create repeatable and scalable processes will thrive in this role.

This position requires both a head for technical problems and a heart for people problems. As such, no single academic or professional background is preferred over another. Our team is diverse and interdisciplinary, and we welcome your interesting, non-traditional, and/or early career experiences.

Responsibilities

Proactive engagement with APAC community members to foster a supportive environment across Slack, GitHub, and other channels to set shared objectives, create open dialogue, build partnerships, and balance the interests of the foundation while sharing best practices
Project and/or Program management responsibilities over strategic initiatives specific to APAC community interaction
Track issues around GitHub, Slack, and Reddit and act as a liaison between the Filecoin community and the Filecoin Foundation
Identify hurdles and pain points across the ecosystem, and act as a wayfinder to alleviate these issues
Drive engagement around ecosystem and/or community releases and updates
Maintain and connect community members and internal parties to develop a solid network of cross-functional trusted relationships
Help build strategic capacity for network growth by identifying common issues and barriers, and prioritize related improvements
Be involved in creating documentation, including writing specs and other documents as needed
Facilitate community events that align to our OKRs that drive impact across the community

Your Profile

Experience driving collaboration within the Asian market
Significant experience in program management, community engagement, and/or technology strategy and execution
You are detail-oriented and love to see projects from start to finish with an eye towards project management disciplines
You have a passion for engaging community, can develop a presence across multiple channels, and can find new communities to tap into
Exceptional written and verbal communication skills and interpersonal skills
Proactive, enthusiastic, and able to self-motivate; you love to take on new projects, initiatives and programs
You are able to multi-task and context-switch with ease as you drive community engagement based on agreed upon priorities
You can pull threads across multiple platforms to identify blockers, then triage to find the solutions
You are familiar with launching scalable community initiatives and can help track relevant metrics in relation to company OKRs
You can tap into enthusiasm for new ideas, organizations, and opportunities, and then proactively organize community members around them
Extremely comfortable working with CRMs on a daily basis (Hubspot, Salesforce, Pipeline, etc.)
You are not afraid of highly technical concepts or conversations
Able to travel up to :30% of the year, primarily in Asia
Must be located in proximity to Singapore

Here, your customer focus and love for fashion, design and business is supported and encouraged, and your individual contribution can truly make a difference.

About H&M Production

Transform design ideas into real products at H&M Production. The direct point of contact for local suppliers in over 20 sourcing markets, we ensure that top-quality products are made as sustainably and cost-effectively as possible.

Job Description

Put your passion for fashion at the center of our supply chain.

As Merchandiser you pretty much run our product offer. By managing and optimizing the entire workflow, you ensure that we secure the best deal for each home product. Now, ‘best deal’ might sound simple at face value. But there’s a bit more to it than that. In essence, it’s about striking the right balance between a few different things.

Of course, you need to get the best price. For us, for the customer. But you also need to consider production lead-times, so that items are in store and online when they need to be. You need to factor in quality. Does the product have the right look and feel? Is it safe, user-friendly, or comfortable to wear? And always, these need to be considered with sustainability in mind. You are responsible to understand competitive environment and get the correct balance between the expectations of the customer and the objectives of the company's strategy. You are a point of contact with existing and new home textile suppliers, building and maintaining strong relationships with them. You monitor suppliers’ performance and manage supplier relations related to short and long-term goals of production by considering all success factors such as price, fashion, speed, sustainable material and innovation.

You work in cooperation with Supply Chain, other brand/assortment groups to secure best production and to optimize procurement procedures. You feed the Supply Chain team with your customer group strategy in your country/region and give them the vision to build required capacity. During the business execution, you build cooperation with Supply Chain to align and secure optimized procurement procedures. But it’s not just about using data and product textile knowledge to develop creative solutions. It’s an intensively collaborative position, too.

Qualifications

The person we are looking for must have experience in order follow-up & price negotiation. A team player, who can drive towards the common goal and should preferably have extensive knowledge in handling different home textile products, material, and components production. Communication skills will also be a key element when deciding who we will hire for the role as you will need to build relationships across Production and Buying Office. To be successful in this role, you need to have strong analytical skills for anticipating potential challenges on a global level, suggesting optimizations, and resolving issues. Most importantly, we are looking for someone who have strong ownership and can work independently.

This role touches almost the entire supply chain, so you need to proactively manage various internal stakeholders globally, balancing different, sometimes competing—or even conflicting— priorities and somehow finding your way through it all to reach a mutually beneficial outcome. When it works, it’s a symphony of global level coordination. And when it doesn’t, you have contingent strategies in place to minimize the impact.

Apart from these skills, you must also have:

Academic background in Textile Engineering is preferable
8-10 years of working experience with Home Textile Product
Ability to multi-task and work under pressure
A flexible, positive, and inspirational team player

Additional Information

Is H&M right for me?

People who are happy and do well at H&M tend to thrive on using their intuition and common sense. We might be the place of possibility, but we’re also a place of ambiguity and constant change. This is not a company for micro-managers or people who operate on autopilot. This is a company where your opinions will inform business decisions, so you need to enjoy making them heard, questioning how things work, and trying things that you might not be familiar with.

Consequently, we depend on teamwork. And we have a pretty high tolerance for failure, provided you can show you’re learning. You can expect to take on new responsibilities and to move around a bit, too, so this could be the start of a varied and rewarding career if that’s what you’re looking for.

Thinking about applying?

If all of this sounds like it might be your kind of thing then you should definitely apply by 27 January, 2023. If your CV is selected then a recruiter will invite you for a phone / video call, followed by a couple of interviews.

H&M is committed to creating a Diverse & Inclusive environment and we are actively looking for qualified candidates irrespective of race, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, national origin, disability or age."

How Does a Hotel Channel Manager System Work?

A hotel channel management system works by automating three core processes; making reservations, setting rates and managing availability. The best channel management is delivered by what the techies call a two-way integration (in most cases). The first direction the data flows in is from the hotelsProperty Management System (PMS)to the world. This will be information about the hotel such as how much the rates for the various rooms are, how many rooms are available and the types of rooms available. The second direction the data flows in, is from the world to the hotels Property Management System. In this case, OTAs, STOs and the GDS supply information to the hotel such as the guest name, how many guests, duration of stay as well as the payment method. Automating this procedure is incredibly valuable as it is quite cumbersome and overwhelming for an individual to manage. This applies to massive hotels and small 5 bedroom guest houses alike.

Channel Managers Work By

Supplying OTAs, STOs and the GDS with rates, availability and room types
Receiving all guest booking information from OTAs, STOs and the GDS
Updating availability and rates on the PMS and the Channel Manager in real-time
Automatically inserting confirmed reservations into yourProperty Management System
As a result of the above features pooled inventory and rate parity become easy to manage

Why do you need a Channel Manager System?

The world is no longer the ginormous place it used to be. Having a sales brochure at the airport or local travel agent doesnt have the pull that it did years ago. The internet is where everything happens and the internet is a big, scary and hard-to-navigate place but, thanks to some very smart people, we now have tools like Google and Ecosia that allow us to instantly find what we need and when we need it. A channel manager is a tool that anyone can use that gives you the possibility to instantly update, via the internet, the worlds biggest travel agents with all the information they need to sell your rooms for you and, as a bonus, the channel manager also automatically updates you with all the essential guest information.

The Key Functions Of a Channel Manager Are

Lists your property on sites like booking.com, Tripadvisor and Expedia
Allows you to set your rates
Takes care of rate parity for you
You receive confirmed bookings without having to directly deal with guest queries
Sends you reports so you know which channels are working best and where to focus your future attention

How to Choose the Best Hotel Channel Manager Software?

Here Are Some Questions That We Recommend You Ask Your Providers To Make Sure You Maintain Optimal Control Over The Channel Mix As Well As Maximise Profitability

Hotel channel manager software is a tool, and like any tool, you have to know what you want to use it for. Using a banana to knock in a nail will fail miserably (unless you freeze the banana beforehand). So when choosing a channel manager it helps to know exactly what you want it to do.

How many channels does your channel manager connect to?
Does the channel manager connect to OTAs, STOs and the GDS?
Is there a pooled inventory function?
Does it accommodate restrictions? i.e. Rates and availability, maximum and minimum stays, number of guests, etc.
How far in advance can you manage availability and rates?
What reports does it provide?
Which of the channels deliver the most bookings?
Which provides the most revenue?
Where do my guests come from?
How are my guests finding out about my hotel?

They are multi-tenant distributed systems implemented in Go and running on Kubernetes across all major Cloud providers (GCP, Azure, AWS). We also have engineers working on Prometheus, Grafana Agent, and the Mimir proxies.

As a company we are remote-first and global, we embrace people of different experiences and backgrounds to build diverse teams where every person brings a new perspective to the software.

Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Forward Kitchens. Have you got what it takes?

On-demand food delivery is the future of restaurants. However, most restaurants are either ill-equipped or unaware of how to unlock their full delivery revenue potential through digitization. A restaurant’s digital presence could be the difference between a viral hit like Salt Bae’s booming global steak empire (which is just ok, if you ask us) and your favorite mom-and-pop hole-in-the-wall that went out of business during the pandemic.

That’s where Forward Kitchens comes in. We empower restaurants to create multiple digital storefronts each, generate more online sales, and increase their bottom line – all without having to hire a creative marketing team or deal with the millions (we’re exaggerating) of delivery platforms out there. We believe in our partner restaurants’ power to represent their communities and provide delicious, eclectic meals to their ever-ravenous customers at scale.

In this role, you will play a major part in building our modern restaurant operating system, including delivery tablet aggregation, automated websites, online ordering, and much more. This is a fast-paced, high-impact work environment, so be prepared to move quickly and ship often. If you’re a Python developer with experience working in a fast-paced engineering culture and a keen eye for detail, then this role is for you!

What You Will Be Doing

Building the company's newest features; sample projects include Android applications that power kitchen operations and order deliveries, beautiful web applications with rich data visualizations, highly scalable cloud/serverless backend systems, and robust, scalable data pipelines

What You Won’t Be Doing

Working on minor bug fixes or features on outdated codebases
Dealing with tedious infrastructure to enable poorly written products to continue running
Managing people or getting stuck on long meetings discussing roadmaps and priorities

Basic Requirements

Python Developer key responsibilities

At least 3 years of experience coding with Python
Professional experience using EC2 and AWS Lambda

Off-premise operating system for restaurants.

884,884,Hotel Channel Manager,EXPERT SOLUTION POINT Bangladesh On-site,Full-time · Mid-Senior level,"This job is sourced from a job board. Learn more
How Does a Hotel Channel Manager System Work?

A hotel channel management system works by automating three core processes; making reservations, setting rates and managing availability. The best channel management is delivered by what the techies call a two-way integration (in most cases). The first direction the data flows in is from the hotelsProperty Management System (PMS)to the world. This will be information about the hotel such as how much the rates for the various rooms are, how many rooms are available and the types of rooms available. The second direction the data flows in, is from the world to the hotels Property Management System. In this case, OTAs, STOs and the GDS supply information to the hotel such as the guest name, how many guests, duration of stay as well as the payment method. Automating this procedure is incredibly valuable as it is quite cumbersome and overwhelming for an individual to manage. This applies to massive hotels and small 5 bedroom guest houses alike.

Channel Managers Work By

Supplying OTAs, STOs and the GDS with rates, availability and room types
Receiving all guest booking information from OTAs, STOs and the GDS
Updating availability and rates on the PMS and the Channel Manager in real-time
Automatically inserting confirmed reservations into yourProperty Management System
As a result of the above features pooled inventory and rate parity become easy to manage

Why do you need a Channel Manager System?

The world is no longer the ginormous place it used to be. Having a sales brochure at the airport or local travel agent doesnt have the pull that it did years ago. The internet is where everything happens and the internet is a big, scary and hard-to-navigate place but, thanks to some very smart people, we now have tools like Google and Ecosia that allow us to instantly find what we need and when we need it. A channel manager is a tool that anyone can use that gives you the possibility to instantly update, via the internet, the worlds biggest travel agents with all the information they need to sell your rooms for you and, as a bonus, the channel manager also automatically updates you with all the essential guest information.

The Key Functions Of a Channel Manager Are

Lists your property on sites like booking.com, Tripadvisor and Expedia
Allows you to set your rates
Takes care of rate parity for you
You receive confirmed bookings without having to directly deal with guest queries
Sends you reports so you know which channels are working best and where to focus your future attention

How to Choose the Best Hotel Channel Manager Software?

Here Are Some Questions That We Recommend You Ask Your Providers To Make Sure You Maintain Optimal Control Over The Channel Mix As Well As Maximise Profitability

Hotel channel manager software is a tool, and like any tool, you have to know what you want to use it for. Using a banana to knock in a nail will fail miserably (unless you freeze the banana beforehand). So when choosing a channel manager it helps to know exactly what you want it to do.

How many channels does your channel manager connect to?
Does the channel manager connect to OTAs, STOs and the GDS?
Is there a pooled inventory function?
Does it accommodate restrictions? i.e. Rates and availability, maximum and minimum stays, number of guests, etc.
How far in advance can you manage availability and rates?
What reports does it provide?
Which of the channels deliver the most bookings?
Which provides the most revenue?
Where do my guests come from?
How are my guests finding out about my hotel?

Business : Abroad Inquiry was born in 2017 from an altruist Facebook group that has helped hundreds of international students pursue higher study abroad worldwide. Abroad Inquiry`s a community-based platform run by a group of international students from different countries. Why was the Abroad Inquiry born? The common thing that we noticed is that students are being provided with false information and misleading career guidelines from unauthentic sources, resulting in the refusal of their visa application and career breakthrough. This is not a refusal; we think it’s the death of a dream. At our Abroad Inquiry, we provide all accurate factual information related to higher study abroad that we have acquired from our real-life experience and thorough research. We believe that a current student who has already gone through the hectic study abroad journey can be the best source of information and understand the situation better than others. The information obtained is more authentic than online sources or any other student consultancy firms. Thus, we have built this platform to help upcoming students.

Our mentors have already graduated from top-notch universities in different countries. Moreover, some of them are working at reputed companies working relentlessly to ease the journey of potential future students. However, we decided to serve upcoming students because, as international students, we experienced the same thing before going to a new place. For instance, sufficient information, the difficulty of getting admission, preparation of necessary documents as per the requirement of the respective university, and visa consular office are essential to know from authentic sources. We have an expert team of passionate individuals who are professional to make your dream of studying abroad into a reality. Furthermore, we also provide comprehensive guidelines to manage housing, part-time jobs, study advice, Permanent Residency, etc.

In a nutshell, our company provides complete support from admission to settlement in a foreign country. In addition, students will get all the support and motivation from our mentors who run this company.
