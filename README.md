# most-in-demand-ICT-skills-in-bangladesh-2023
In this one-day data science project, I analyzed the most in-demand ICT skills in Bangladesh by collecting data from 1344 job posts on LinkedIn and BDjobs using Python and Selenium, and then manipulating and analyzing the data using Pandas. The results were visualized using matplotlib and Google spreadsheets. The project aimed to showcase my data science skills, but due to time constraints, I consciously limited the complexity of the project and did not incorporate Natural Language Processing techniques for data manipulation, leading to some limitations such as unclear skill names(C,Foundation framework etc) that had to be left unchanged for the machine to process.
